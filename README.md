# Fake News Dataset üìä
Welcome to the Fake News Dataset repository! This dataset is curated to support research and development in fake news detection systems, including deep learning models like LSTM and BiLSTM. It is intended for educational and research purposes only.

## üìÑ Dataset Overview
The Fake News Dataset contains labeled news articles and headlines designed to train machine learning models to distinguish between real and fake news. This dataset is ideal for projects in NLP and fake news detection, including the TruthGuard system.

## Data Format
Each record in the dataset includes the following fields:

### ID: 
Unique identifier for each news article.
### Title: 
Headline of the news article.
### Text: 
Full text of the news article (when available).
### Label: 
Classification of news as either fake or real.

## Data Structure
The dataset is stored in CSV format with the following structure:

| ID   | Title                      | Text                           | Label |
|------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| 1    | "Breaking News Headline"   | "Detailed article text here."  | fake  |
| 2    | "Another News Headline"    | "Another article text here."   | real  |
| ...  | ...                        | ...                            | ...   |
